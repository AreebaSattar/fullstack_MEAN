## Challenges Faced During the Implemenation of a Project and Reflection 

### Challenges Faced
1. **Setting up an Angular Project**
   - At start, I faced challenges while setting up the Angular project.
   - Since I was using JetBrains IDE (WebStorm), when I created Angular project, server files got added into frontend side project and I got confused in that.
   - To resolve this I looked up online resources and read documetation. Helpful resource that I found was [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), where I explored project setups and identified my mistakes.
2. **New to Angular and MongoDB**
   - As I am new to Angular and have less prior experience with MongoDb, understanding few things at start took additional time.
   - Installing and setting up the tools like postman and mongoDB before starting project also took extra time.
3. **Error Handling**
   - While connecting the frontend and beackend I encountered errors in start and debugging those were challenging but I kept pushing through with the hope of completing at least backend side and database setup and connection and integarting the frontend with backend.
  
### Reasons for Incomplete Tasks
1. **Time limitation**
   - Given timeframe was short and installing setup (installing tools, reading docs and understanding few concepts) took time.
2. **Learning Curve**
   - As this was my first project involving Angular and MongoDB, I spent extra time familiarizing myself with these technologies, leaving the less time for implementation.

### POtential Solutions if were given Extra Time
1. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - With more time, I would focus on debugging the errors and ensuring seamless connectivity between the frontend and backend.
2. **Better Planning**:
   - I would plan the tasks in smaller modules and complete them step by step, ensuring each part is tested thoroughly before moving forward, although at some extent I did that now too but I had time in my mind that I have to complete this by this time.

Despite the challenges, I learned a lot and managed to connect the frontend and backend and completed the backend side, which gave me a sense of accomplishment.
