# Full Stack Application - Angular & Express with JWT Authentication
# MEAN STACK PROJECT :)

This repository contains a full-stack application with an Angular frontend, an Express backend, and MongoDB as the database. The app implements JWT authentication, user roles (Admin and User), file upload, and file sharing functionality.

## Prerequisites
At first I installed all these:
- **Node.js** (LTS version) - [Downloaded the Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) - Package manager
- **MongoDB** - [Installed MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
- **Angular CLI** - Installed via npm: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
- **Postman** - For testing the API routes (backend)

## Project Structure
The application is split into two main parts:
I have used the jetbrains IDE (Webstorm) for both frontend and backend.
1. **Backend** - Express API handling authentication, file uploads, and file sharing.
2. **Frontend** - Angular application providing the user interface.

## Step-by-Step Setup 
- **Created a folder for the backend project and initialize Node.js Project**
  ```bash
  mkdir backend
